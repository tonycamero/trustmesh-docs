# Tokenization Model

- **Strong trust:** **Device-Bound Tokens (DBTs)** = your 9 commitment slots. DBTs are **not NFTs**; theyï¿½re device-key-bound authorizations managed by the Registry.
- **Lite trust:** **Contacts** are unlimited, consented connections; private by default; low analytic weight.
- **Engagement assets:** **NFTs** (redeemable/POAP) and **hashinals** as portable, **non-financial** artifacts for campaigns and acknowledgments.
- **Revocation:** Quiet unbonding (~72h) ? REVOKE ? per-slot cooldown (~14d). No public shaming.
