# Vision
**Make trust portable.** TrustMesh maps intentional, IRL commitments into a verifiable, privacy-preserving network.

## Mission
Deliver a mobile-first, Hedera-backed trust layer with:
- **9 device-bound commitment slots** (Circle of Trust)
- **Quiet unbonding** and per-slot cooldown
- **Contacts (lite trust)** for safe discovery/routing
- **TRST payments** (Brale KYC/AML; MatterFi flows)
- **IRB-ready privacy posture** (cohort-peppered HMAC; aggregate visibility)

## Differentiators
- Scarce & revocable strong trust (DBTs) + unlimited lite contacts
- Hedera-native identity, messaging, and assets
- Licensed kernel; predictable scaling and governance
