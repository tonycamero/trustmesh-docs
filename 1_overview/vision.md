# Vision & Mission

**Vision:** TrustMesh turns everyday acts of trust into a portable, verifiable social signal—privacy-first and human-centered.

**Mission:** Ship a mobile-first, Hedera-backed trust layer with **non-custodial wallets** and **9 revocable trust slots** per person, optimized for research-grade integrity and campus-scale adoption.

**Key Differentiators**
- Scarcity & revocability (9 slots, quiet unbonding)
- Cohort-salted pseudonymity; privacy by design
- HCS-first event stream; deterministic state spec
- Research alignment (IRB-ready modes, aggregate visibility)

**Target Audiences**: Students (RAs/residents), faculty/researchers, civic orgs.
