- `4_research_academic/` — Research alignment, KPIs, pilot plans
- `5_development_plan/` — Roadmaps, sprints, risks, deployment
- `6_legal_compliance/` — GDPR, TCPA, ToS, retention/deletion
- `7_collaboration_governance/` — Contrib guide, comms, style, glossary
- `assets/` — Diagrams, wireframes, and exported visuals
